# LEETCODE-EASY-PROBLEMS
This is a repository for my regular leetcode easy problem solutions

Problem 1: ( Solution: duplicatezeros.py )
Given a fixed length array arr of integers, duplicate each occurrence of zero, shifting the remaining elements to the right.
Note that elements beyond the length of the original array are not written.
Do the above modifications to the input array in place, do not return anything from your function.

Problem 2: ( Solution: TwoSum.py )
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.
